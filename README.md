# mapty-app

A lecture project to track user running and cycling activity from Jonas's Javascript Course on Udemy. The main purpose of this project is to create a track history from the user running and cycling activity. User can select their current location and it will display the workout form to fill (either running or cycling).

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Notes

This Mapty App project code, ideas, and design credited to Jonas Schmedtmann in his Complete Javascript Course. I'm not claiming this project was made by me, this is only for learning purpose and my study portfolio.
